# Symposium

## Description

As a team of web developers, it's important to show that we thoroughly understand how all aspects of a MERN Stack Application function and how they interact with one another. For example, we need to be able to show how MongoDB shares its queries and mutations with React components, how user interactions on React components modify data stored in MongoDB, and how Express facilitates the interactions between these components. To demonstrate this, we created Symposium, an online music player that allows users to create an account, create and rename playlists, add and remove songs from their playlists, and delete playlists as needed.

## Installation

You can find Symposium on Heroku at the link below:

## Usage

Once you access the app via the link above, you'll need to connect your Spotify Premium account by clicking on the Connect Spotify button. Then, click on the Login button to log in and create a new account. From there, you'll be able to create and rename playlists, add and remove songs from playlists, and delete playlists.
